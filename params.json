{"name":"LtiLibrary","tagline":".NET libraries for working with IMS LTI","body":"LtiLibrary is a collection of libraries for .NET applications using IMS LTI.\r\n\r\n\"Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a specification developed by [IMS Global Learning Consortium](http://wwwimsglobal.org). The principal concept of LTI is to establish a standard way of integrating rich learning applications (often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with platforms like learning management systems, portals, or other educational environments. In LTI these learning applications are called Tools (delivered by Tool Providers) and the LMS, or platforms, are called Tool Consumers.\" - [IMS Global Developer](http://developers.imsglobal.org/)\r\n\r\nI'm posting about LtiLibrary on [my blog](http://andyfmiller.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
